# Finite approximate identities

This module isolates the finite algebra behind an approximate identity.  A
kernel is a finite list of rational sample points with nonnegative rational
weights of total mass one.  Its action is therefore an executable rational
weighted sum.

No integral, topology, completed real number, or limiting assertion occurs
here.  A later quadrature construction can use this theorem after proving
that its finite weights have mass one and are concentrated in a region where
the sampled function has a stated rational modulus.
