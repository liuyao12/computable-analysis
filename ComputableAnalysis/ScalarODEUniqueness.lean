# Direct scalar ODE uniqueness by finite mesh contraction

This module is deliberately separate from `PeanoBaker`.  For the scalar
initial-value problem `f' = f`, a direct rational mesh proof is shorter than
a general Volterra or Peano--Baker argument.  On a sufficiently short time
block, a finite subdivision turns the zero-initial difference estimate into a
strict contraction.  Refining the subdivision gives a sequence of rational
error envelopes, each at most half its predecessor.

The analytic work is to build the one-step mesh estimate from the two
derivative certificates.  The closure below is completely finite: the
explicit dyadic schedule converts repeated halving into equality of raw
interval representatives, with no complete function space and no Picard
iteration.
